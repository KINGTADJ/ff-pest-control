**Features:**
- Instant knockdown effect
- Residual protection for weeks

- Professional-grade formula

## 2. Gel Baits

Gel baits are highly effective for cockroach and ant control. They work by attracting pests who then carry the poison back to their nest.

## 3. Rodent Bait Stations

Secure bait stations are essential for rat and mouse control, especially in homes with children or pets.

## 4. Bed Bug Sprays

Look for products containing pyrethroids for effective bed bug control. Always follow up with professional treatment for severe infestations.

Essential for outdoor living in UAE. Options include:

Termite control requires professional-grade products. Consider pre-construction soil treatment for new builds.

## 9. Multi-Surface Disinfectants

While not pest control per se, keeping surfaces clean helps prevent pest attraction.

## 10. Natural/Organic Options

For those preferring eco-friendly solutions:
- Diatomaceous earth

## Where to Buy Pest Control Products in UAE

# 10 Home Maintenance Tips to Prevent Pests

Prevention is the best pest control strategy. These simple maintenance tasks will make your home less attractive to pests.

## 1. Seal Entry Points

Pests enter through tiny gaps. Inspect and seal:
- Cracks in foundation
- Gaps around pipes and wires
- Door and window frames
- AC and vent openings

**Materials:** Caulk, steel wool, weather stripping

## 2. Fix Water Leaks

Pests need water to survive.
- Check under sinks
- Inspect outdoor taps
- Fix dripping faucets
- Repair leaky pipes

Many pests (cockroaches, silverfish) love moisture.

## 3. Proper Food Storage

Don't give pests a free meal:
- Use airtight containers
- Clean up spills immediately
- Don't leave pet food out
- Store fruits in refrigerator

## 4. Regular Garbage Management

Garbage attracts pests quickly:
- Use bins with tight lids
- Take out garbage daily
- Clean bins regularly
- Keep outdoor bins away from doors

## 5. Maintain Your Yard

Overgrown vegetation harbors pests:
- Trim bushes near house
- Remove leaf piles
- Cut grass regularly
- Remove standing water

## 6. Check Screens and Doors

Keep flying pests out:
- Repair torn screens
- Install door sweeps
- Check for gaps around frames
- Use screen on vents

## 7. Reduce Clutter

Clutter provides hiding spots:
- Organize storage areas
- Don't pile newspapers/cardboard
- Use plastic bins (not cardboard)
- Regular decluttering

## 8. Clean Regularly

Sanitation is key:
- Vacuum weekly
- Clean under appliances
- Wipe counters daily
- Don't leave dirty dishes

## 9. Inspect Items Before Bringing Inside

Pests hitchhike on:
- Cardboard boxes
- Second-hand furniture
- Grocery bags
- Luggage after travel

## 10. Schedule Professional Prevention

Even with perfect maintenance:
- Quarterly professional treatment
- Annual termite inspection
- Professional assessment

[F & F Pest Control](/services) offers maintenance programs for year-round protection.

## Cost of Prevention vs Treatment

| | Prevention | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| General pests | AED 150-200/quarter | AED 300-500/visit |
| Termites | AED 500/year inspection | AED 3000-8000 treatment |

# Mosquito Control in UAE: Protect Your Family

Mosquitoes are more than just annoying - they can transmit diseases. In UAE's warm climate, mosquito control is essential for outdoor comfort and health protection.

## Mosquito-Borne Diseases

Mosquitoes can transmit:

Even without disease, bites cause discomfort and allergic reactions.

Mosquitoes breed in standing water. Check:
- Plant saucers

- Pet water bowls

**Tip:** Empty and clean weekly!

### Personal Protection

- Use repellents (DEET, picaridin)
- Wear long sleeves/pants at dusk
- Install screens on windows
- Use bed nets if needed
- Avoid outdoor activity at dawn/dusk

### Home Protection

- Ensure screens are intact
- Use fans (mosquitoes are weak fliers)
- Seal gaps around doors
- Keep vegetation trimmed

## Professional Mosquito Control

### Larvicide Treatment
- Applied to water that can't be drained
- Kills mosquito larvae
- Lasts 30+ days

### Adult Mosquito Fogging

### Monthly Maintenance Program

## Cost of Mosquito Control

| One-time fogging | 200-400 |
| Larvicide treatment | 150-300 |

| Monthly program | 300-500 |

## When Are Mosquitoes Most Active?

# Pre-Construction Pest Treatment: Essential for New Buildings

Pre-construction pest treatment is one of the most important steps in building a property that will remain pest-free for years. In UAE, it's not just recommended—it's often required by building codes.

## What Is Pre-Construction Treatment?

Pre-construction pest treatment involves applying pesticides and barriers before a building is completed, typically:
- In the soil before foundation is poured
- Around foundations
- In walls before closing up
- Around utility entries

## Why It's Essential

### Cost-Effective
- Treating soil is cheaper than post-construction
- Prevents costly damage repairs
- One-time investment for years of protection

### More Effective
- Creates complete barrier
- No gaps or missed areas
- Can't be achieved post-construction

### UAE Building Codes
- Required in many municipalities
- Must be documented
- Certificate needed for completion

## Types of Pre-Construction Treatment

### Soil Treatment
- Applied before foundation
- Creates chemical barrier
- Prevents subterranean termites

### Anti-Termite Barrier
- Applied around foundation
- Physical or chemical barriers
- Long-lasting protection

### Pipe/Cable Entry Treatment
- Applied around all penetrations
- Prevents entry points
- Often overlooked in DIY

## The Treatment Process

1. **Site Assessment**
   - Soil analysis
   - Risk evaluation
   - Treatment plan

2. **Soil Preparation**
   - Before compacting
   - Complete coverage
   - Documentation

3. **Foundation Treatment**
   - After excavation
   - Around footings
   - Certified application

4. **During Construction**

   - Warranty documentation
   - Municipality approval

## Products Used

- Imidacloprid
- Bifenthrin

All products must be UAE-approved.

## Cost of Pre-Construction Treatment

| Property Type | Price (AED/sqm) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Villa | 3-6 |
| Building | 4-8 |
| Commercial | 5-10 |

Exact pricing depends on:
- Property size
